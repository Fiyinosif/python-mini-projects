## 📘 What You'll Find Here

Each project includes:
- A description of its purpose
- Key Python concepts it covers
- Instructions for running it

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Data types (strings, integers, booleans, floats)
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else, match-case)
- Loops (for, while)
- Input/output handling

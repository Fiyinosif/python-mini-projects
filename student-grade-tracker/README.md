# Student Grade Tracker 📚

A terminal-based Python app that helps track and evaluate student performance by name and grade.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Add a student's name and grade
- View all records with performance evaluation:
  - A – Excellent (80+)
  - B – Good (60–79)
  - C – Pass (40–59)
  - F – Fail (below 40)
- Search for a student by name
- Exit the program gracefully

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Dictionaries
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
- Input/output handling
- Basic error handling (optional upgrade)

---

## 🛠 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run the script:

```bash
python student_grade_tracker.py
📝 Sample Output: 
Pick an option: 1
Student name: Jason
Student grade: 84

Pick an option: 2
Student name: Jason , Student grade: 84, Result: A - Excellent
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements (optional ideas)
Save/load data to a file (CSV or JSON)

Allow grade updates or deletion

Add input validation for invalid entries

Use functions to avoid repeating grading logic
